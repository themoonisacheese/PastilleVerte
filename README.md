# PastilleVerte
Discord bot for virtual-internet-points keeping

This repo is for people that are curious as to how I did it, altough if you wanted you could host you own version.

# How To Use:
don't. please.

if you really want to you can put your bot's token in token.txt, and run `node discordbot.js`

I will not provide support if you try running this, but feel free to make a Pull request.

# How To Use 2 : electric boogaloo

Here are my commands:

		=karma [@user]  - See user's total score. If no user is provided then see your own karma
		
		=karmacount     - Enumerates the total amount of know users across all guilds
		
		=karmahelp      - See this helpful help message.
		
		=karmainvite    - Get an invite link.
		
How do I work? Simply react to messages you like or don\'t like with the :thumbsup: or :thumbsdown: emoji. This will then increase or decrease the message author's karma.
